## Script Repository ##

A repository to store and manage scripts such as `sql`,`bash` and etc..

### Description ###

Sometimes we want to run sql scripts automatically against the dev db,of course we can use git/hg to store these script files,but as the project goes on,more and more scripts should be applied to database,if we do it manually,it will be rather boring,so I create this app to store scripts and then use this app to merge all the scripts into a single file.

*THIS PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPING!*
